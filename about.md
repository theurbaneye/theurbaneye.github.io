Our cities are ever more interconnected. A single person typically has no idea where the food they eat comes from, where does the waste go, how does water reach their house, or how are products distributed in a city. In this interconnectedness of an urban organism, it becomes hard to see the inefficiencies and gaps unless all this data is mapped to a single platform. By using a software centric design, we aim to enthuse efficiency and sustainability into the actions of all stakeholders involved.

# Vision
The vision of our organization is to provide state of the art geospatial intelligence for a more efficient and sustainable operation of the city. 

# Mission
Our mission is to empower 10+ organizations with usable and productive geospatial solutions thus affecting more than 25 cities by 2026.

# Method
Our solutions use a mixture of very high resolution imagery from Maxar, multispectral daily images from PlanetScope and an even wider spectral information through Sentinel2 and Landsat satellites to develop a comprehensive and robust solution. We work very closely with our users to understand their needs and to ensure that the developed solution is adopted and practical for the use case.
